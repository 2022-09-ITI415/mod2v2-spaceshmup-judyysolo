# 05-Space-SHMUP
 
One of the most popular SHMUP games of all time has to be Space Invaders. In my SHMUP game, I add an enemy modeled after a space invader--its ability is to invade your
space. The health of the invader is 1000, so the player is not meant to kill it. Instead, it moves slowly down the screen for the player to avoid. These space invaders are
very likely to spawn and should be in your space in no time. Like other enemies, touching them means taking damage and possible death.

The game has the weapons tuned so that they are more powerful off the bat. The spawn rate of enemies is slightly less than it was before tuning, from .5 to .4.
The player also has the option to use a laser weapon in addition to the tuned Blaster and Spread weapons.
